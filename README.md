# Prysm Validator Remote Wallet

----
## What is this?
This is a remote wallet manager for a prysm validator. 
The idea is to be able to connect to a validator infrastructure (might not be controlled by you) and still maintain a high level of security.

a.k.a hold and manage your own keys

TODO
1) add slashing protection to server example.
2) wallet key management (create) and eth 1.0 deposit transaction data. Could use [ethdo](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo)
3) add admin RPC methods for managing the wallet (adding new keys, locking and so on)
